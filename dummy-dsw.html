<p align = "center">Astrology is an extremely complex study, the most fundamental principle of astrology centers on the 12 familiar star signs of the zodiac. Over the centuries, each sign has developed its own associations — including myths, animals, and colors — and its own characteristics. Every sign is illuminated by its own point of view, complete with powerful strengths and exhausting weaknesses.</p><br>
<p align = "center">Aries(March 21-April 19):</p>
<img src = "aries.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">Hello, Aries, and welcome to 2022! Remember, you're the first sign of the zodiac, and as a result, insist on getting your way (and usually do). But, dear ram, if your love life feels at a stand-still lately, that should change when Venus goes direct on Saturday, January 29. When Venus, the planet of romance, is retrograde, working through relationship issues can feel like navigating your way out of quicksand. Thankfully, the planet goes direct just in time for Valentine's Day, so be your bold Aries self and tell your crush or partner exactly what you want this year. </p><br>
<p align = "center">And, while you're at it, start making that birthday wishlist because Aries season begins on Sunday, March 20. As a fire sign, you feed on attention, and that's not a bad thing. You deserve to feel special during your birthday because you are. You're optimistic, brave, and your determination inspires others. Mercury, the planet of communication, enters your sign on Sunday, March 27, where it will stay until Sunday, April 10. While Mercury is in Aries, you'll find that communication flows easily, and friends and lovers text back promptly. So, start sending those birthday invitations. 2022 is a year for celebrating life, and your inner circle is ready to celebrate you.</p><br>
<p align = "center">Use the new moon in your sign on Friday, April 1, to write down a list of goals for your professional life. No, darling Aries, this isn't dull homework. You may be manifesting some money moves.. New moons mark new beginnings. Venus enters your sign on Monday, May 2, and will stay until Saturday, May 28. As discussed, Venus rules romance, but it's also the planet of beauty and abundance. So if you're going to ask for a raise or promotion, May is the perfect month, as goddess Venus says you deserve to earn what you're worth. </p><br>
<p align = "center">Abundance continues to be a theme for you, Aries, when Lucky planet Jupiter enters your sign on Tuesday, May 10, where it will stay until Friday, October 28. Jupiter is the planet of expansion, travel, and higher learning. During these months, wealth may come easier than usual. Try to refrain from being pushy, darling ram, but remember: you must ask for what you want to get it. Relay your professional ambitions and desired salary to the people who matter, and keep fighting until you get it. Your ruling planet is Mars, the god of war, after all. If anyone knows how to get what they want, it's you.</p><br>
<p align = "center">And speaking of Mars, your ruling planet enters your sign on Tuesday, May 24, where it will stay until Tuesday, July 5, adding even more firepower to your winning streak. While Mars in Aries will make it even easier to assert yourself, beware of becoming overly competitive or aggressive. As an Aries, you don't mind burning bridges from time to time. However, an evolved Aries knows when to unleash hell and when to cooperate.</p><br>
<p align = "center">2022 ends on a lucky note when Jupiter re-enters your sign on Tuesday, December 20, showering you once again with stardust just in time for the holidays. Remember to give thanks for all the blessings this year brought your way, and promise to stay safe and have fun.</p><br>
<p align = "center">Taurus(April 20-May 20):</p>
<img src = "taurus.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">Welcome to the new year, darling Taurus. While fresh starts excite you and 2022 brings many gifts, you may feel as if you're walking through molasses for the first few weeks of the year. This is because your ruling planet, Venus, is retrograde. Venus rules love, money, and beauty, which is why you have such a sensual taste, dear Taurus. But when the planet is retrograde, you may feel stagnancy in your love life and any conversation surrounding money. And, don't forget, it's an ill-advised time to make significant changes to your appearance. Thankfully, Venus goes direct on Saturday, January 29, returning your life to a luxurious baseline.</p><br>
<p align = "center">2022 is a transformative year for you. You're craving intimacy more than ever and desire a solid foundation in your romantic relationships. You're a dedicated earth sign and need partnerships that provide comfort, not conflict. So when messenger Mercury enters your sign on Sunday, April 10, where it will stay until Friday, April 29, communication flows like water, especially in your love life. This is an ideal time to have conversations about moving in together, marriage, or any other define-the-relationship topics, which can seem intimidating at times.</p><br>
<p align = "center">Pick out a cake and plan a birthday party because Taurus season begins on Tuesday, April 19. Make sure to spend your season surrounded by earthly pleasures, such as good food</p><br>
<p align = "center">However, do your best to stay out of any drama because there's a new moon and partial solar eclipse in your sign on Saturday, April 30. The traditional astrological advice surrounding eclipses is to lay low to avoid the fallout from the infamous sudden endings they can bring. But eclipses (solar eclipses, in particular) can also welcome new beginnings. Don't be surprised if your social circle shifts during this time. You may fall out of touch with fickle friends only to meet wondrous new people. Welcome the change, Taurus. It's for the best. </p><br>
<p align = "center">Venus comes home and enters your sign, Taurus, on Saturday, May 28, where it will stay through Wednesday, June 22. This transit lowers stress levels and helps life flow easier. Use these weeks to get some serious work done. You'll feel inspired, productive, and the forecast for drama is low. But if you think people aren't treating you like the royalty that you are, fear not. When fighter planet Mars enters your sign on Tuesday, July 5, where it will stay through Saturday, August 20, you transform into a warrior. Suddenly, asking a love interest for a higher level of commitment or an employer for better wages doesn't feel scary. Sometimes, you can feel a bit sluggish, Taurus, and accept life as it is as a result. This is not the case when Mars is in your sign.</p><br>
<p align = "center">On Sunday, July 31, the independent planet Uranus conjuncts the North Node in your sign, Taurus. The North Node represents spiritual lessons that you must learn in this lifetime. Continuing themes from above, this transit sees your social life growing and evolving. The good news is that you're making cool new friends, becoming more successful, and attracting romantic partners whose desires match yours. The bad news is that for this to happen, you may have to end some existing partnerships in 2022. So if you have a "bestie" who is constantly putting you down or a cheating spouse, don't expect them to be in your life for much longer.</p><br>
<p align = "center">2022 is a transformative year, Taurus. Tuesday, November 8, brings a full moon and total lunar eclipse in your sign. This transit bookends the solar eclipse in Taurus earlier this year. The changes in your social life are manifesting abundant fruit. Any emotional pain stemming from breakups finally falls to the wayside as you embrace new relationships with confidence.</p><br>
<p align  = "center">Eclipses can still be dramatic, even when they bring joy, so they're a great excuse to go analog, even for a night. New beginnings are all around you, and remember, Taurus, the best is yet to come. Hold tight to the people who fill your life with stability and confidence. You're allowed to cry over losses, but not for long. When 2022 comes to a close, your social circle is more colorful and filled with joy than you could have imagined. </p>
<p align  = "center">Gemini(May 21-June 20):</p>
<img src = "gemini.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">Welcome to 2022, heartbreaker Gemini. Your ruling planet is Mercury, the messenger of the gods. Mercury rules communication, which explains why you're so good at captivating an audience, whether you're on a first date or in a work meeting. However, you're also more affected by Mercury's infamous retrogrades than other signs. The first Mercury retrograde of the year begins on Friday, January 14, and lasts until Thursday, February 3. As a reminder, during Mercury retrograde, you can expect miscommunications, travel delays, and annoying technological difficulties. Don't stress too much about these; just remember to double-check your emails and texts, allow for extra travel time, and please don't sext the wrong person. </p><br>
<p align = "center">The asteroid Ceres enters your sign on Tuesday, February 8, Gemini, and stays through Sunday, May 15. Ceres is typically associated with the divine feminine, which we all contain regardless of gender. Ceres rules parenthood, food and nourishment, and family life. Don't worry: this doesn't mean that you have to have kids if you don't want them, but it does bode well for your home life. You may see yourself moving in with a partner, finding a new apartment, or simply becoming more interested in spending time at your lovely home than going out and partying. You can enjoy some downtime, Gemini. No one could ever forget about you!</p><br>
<p align = "center">Mercury comes home to your sign, Gemini, on Friday, April 29. The planet is happy in this placement, and you'll notice that you have an even easier time getting your way. But frankly, Gemini, it's probably a good idea to double-check your texts all of the time because your ruling planet is powerful but messy, just like you. On Tuesday, May 10, Mercury goes retrograde again and enters Taurus on Sunday, May 22, before finally going direct on Friday, June 3. Travel and communication should flow more effortlessly, and it's safe to sign important documents. So go ahead and e-mail birthday party invitations because Gemini season begins on Friday, May 20. You're always extra, but this time of year gives you permission to go the extra mile. </p><br>
<p align = "center">There's a new moon in your sign on Monday, May 30. New moons tend to mark new beginnings and are ideal for setting intentions. Use this transit to get your professional goals in order. Identify what you want, and then map out a plan to get it. You're dedicated and charismatic enough to do whatever job you desire. Mercury re-enters your sign on Monday, June 13, where it will stay until Tuesday, July 5. Remember, Gemini: life flows easier when your ruling planet is at home in your sign. So during these blessed few weeks, go ahead and start taking action to put those professional goals into place. </p> <br>
<p align = "center">Every sign is associated with a tarot card, Gemini, and yours is the Lovers. You often get accused of playing the field, but you're just looking for your other twin (and having some fun, in the meantime, of course). Venus enters your sign on Thursday, June 22, where it stays through Sunday, July 17. Venus rules abundance, beauty, and of course, love. Not only may you get some exciting news about money during this time, but magic stardust will rain down on your love life. Expect romantic dates, hot sex, and sweet nothings.</p><br>
<p align = "center">Mercury goes retrograde yet again on Friday, September 9, ending Sunday, October 2. So here's another goal for 2022, Gemini: Make an action plan for Mercury retrogrades. They happen several times a year and hit you hard. Geminis tend to move at the speed of light and text quickly anyways, so make it a regular habit to double-check important emails and texts for typos.</p><br>
<p align = "center">Wednesday, December 7, brings a full moon in your sign, Gemini. Be on the lookout for positive professional news, or exciting creative ideas, because this lunation culminates the intentions you set during the new moon in Gemini.</p> <br>
<p align = "center">Finally, the year ends with one more Mercury retrograde starting on Thursday, December 29. But don't even sweat, Gemini. Remember, you know how to kick Mercury retrograde's ass, now. </p>
<p align  = "center">Cancer(June 21-July 22):</p>
<img src = "cancer.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">Happy December, Cancer. 2022 is coming to a close, but not without some star power to send you out with a bang. Last month, a dark new moon in Sagittarius asked you to create boundaries and set intentions for the rest of the year. This theme continues through December as we all try to navigate the holidays (it's normal to be stressed out this time of year, Cancer). Thankfully, when the dreamy planet Neptune ends its retrograde (which began during June) and goes direct in its home sign of Pisces, you see things from an optimistic viewpoint. When the communication planet Mercury enters business-minded Capricorn and your 7th House of Pleasure on Tuesday, December 6, you can tell overbearing family members no thank you, and say yes to people who bring you joy. Remember, Cancer, you have agency over how you spend the holidays.</p><br>
<p align = "center">The following day, Wednesday, December 7, brings a full moon in Gemini. Whether or not you're celebrating any religious holidays, there's New Year's ahead, plus the usual hustle and bustle as the year draws to a close. This lunation is great for staying in and getting in touch with your witchy side, whether you're using tarot cards, learning your birth chart, or turning a bath into a sacred ritual. There will be plenty of time to party with others later in the month. In fact, once Venus, the planet of love, abundance, and beauty, also enters Capricorn and your 7th House of Pleasure on Friday, December 9, you'll be thankful for taking alone time. This transit brings holiday warmth and cheer to your most treasured relationships, whether that means quality time with your best friend or hot sex with your partner. One thing is for sure: you won't feel alone.</p><br>
<p align = "center">here's just one astrological hurdle to get through before it's time to celebrate 2023. Mercury retrograde begins in Capricorn on Thursday, December 29. Because this retrograde occurs in your 7th House of Pleasure, when plenty of champagne is being popped, be extra gentle with your words, especially when talking to current or potential lovers. Try to be understanding if anyone is late to a party or misses a text. And you can be prone to nostalgia, Cancer, so don't be the ex that creeps into someone's DMs! You've got this. Enjoy the holidays, and see you next year. </p><br>
<p align  = "center">Leo(July 23-August 22):</p>
<img src = "leo.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">Many of us have to make compromises this time of year. For you, perhaps that's holding firm in your boundaries and telling toxic family members you are not spending thousands of dollars to fly and visit them or agreeing to see your partner's hometown rather than your own. Regardless of your plans, it's essential to nurture your friendships and chosen family in addition to any other obligations. If you need the perfect night for a celebration with friends, look no further than Wednesday, December 7, which brings a full moon in Gemini and your 11th House of Friendship. This is an ideal night for getting together with your besties, bonding over holiday drinks, exchanging small gifts, and reminding such folks how much they mean to you. Or, if you're too busy during the week, opt for the weekend of Friday, December 9. Venus, the abundant planet which rules all forms of love, including friendship, enters loyal Capricorn, continuing the loving vibes. </p><br>
<p align = "center">Generally speaking, sometimes, New Year's resolutions can be toxic. So here's another reminder of how beautiful you are, Leo. Thankfully, thanks to the sun entering grounded Capricorn on Wednesday, December 21, you're feeling practical and confident. There's no need to give into diet culture or spend a ton of money. The new moon in Capricorn on Friday, December 23, brings a fresh perspective to your health, whether committing to getting more sleep, prioritizing your mental health, or cutting ties with folks who only bring you down. On this same date, Chiron, an astrologically significant comet known as the "wounded healer," ends its retrograde, which began in July, and goes direct in Aries. The last six months saw you tending to past pain and old wounds, and if you reflect back, you'll notice how much you've grown. You have positivity on the mind. Commit to continuing to prioritize your well-being and happiness as 2022 comes to a close. </p><br>
<p align = "center">While that should be no problem for a beloved Leo like yourself, there is one slight annoyance leading up to New Year's, and that's one final Mercury retrograde, which begins in Capricorn on Thursday, December 29. You've got this, Leo. Just allow yourself extra time to get your glam on before attending any parties because there will be travel delays and miscommunication. But that's fine; if anyone knows the power of arriving fashionably late, it's you, lion. </p><br>
<p align = "center">Virgo(August 23-September 22):</p>
<img src = "virgo.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">The capitalism surrounding the holidays can be off-putting, but you've also worked hard, Virgo, and you deserve to celebrate yourself. Plus, to be frank, December is simply bursting with loving and sensual energy. The full moon in Gemini on Wednesday, December 7, is an ideal night to celebrate your friendships.</p><br>
<p align = "center">Finally, try not to put too much pressure on New Year's Eve, Virgo. Mercury retrograde begins in Capricorn (yes, your house of pleasure!) on Thursday, December 29. As a result, dates could show up late to parties, you could experience miscommunications, and there's always the change of a surprise text from an ex. All holidays come with pressure, but you'll have a better time if you try to let go of that aspect. The stars won't judge you if you want to stay home this year for New Year's Eve. In fact, as the hermit of the zodiac, despite how charismatic you are, you often need alone time to recharge. But if you do go out, there's no doubt you'll look fabulous and enter 2023 ready for whatever comes at you. Happy New Year, Virgo, see you in January! </p><br>
<p align = "center">Libra(September 23-October 22):</p>
<img src = "libra.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">Congrats, Libra, you survived 2022 — or you will have, at least, once this month is over. There are a few more surprises the stars have in store for you, and you can expect significant changes in your home and family life this month</p><br>
<p align = "center">As you may remember, back in November, you desired comfy time at home due to a stressful full moon and lunar eclipse in Taurus. You love beautiful things, Libra. Don't worry; that's not a bad thing. You can't help it — abundant and romantic Venus is your ruling planet. You're the sign of justice, balance, and partnership. When people talk about detail-oriented signs, Virgo usually gets all the attention, but the truth is, you need your home to be a safe haven just as badly. As a result of staying in, you likely noticed changes you want to make in your living space. When Mercury, the messenger of the gods, enters Capricorn and your 4th house of home and family on Tuesday, December 6, you're ready to plan out and implement such changes, whether redecorating or finally talking to your roommate about their refusal to do the dishes.</p><br>
<p align = "center">While it's crucial to communicate your needs, confronting roommates, partners, or anyone who affects your living space can be stressful, especially when everyone is already on edge due to the holidays. Approach such subjects like rent, chores, or redecorating with sensitivity; after all, Wednesday, December 7, brings a full moon in Gemini, a sign that can be prone to gossip. Full moons are beautiful and often a time of welcome change, but they can also start drama. However, thankfully, beautiful and loving Venus (a planet that affects all relationships, not just romantic ones) joins Mercury in Capricorn and your 4th house of home and family on Friday, December 9. As a result of this transit, tackling tough subjects about home life will go over easier than you think, so try to stay grounded and positive. (Check out our Best of Beauty 2022: Home winners to shop gifts for yourself and anyone else looking to level up their living space.)</p><br>
<p align = "center">Your home life continues to be a central theme for you, dear Libra, especially when the sun officially enters Capricorn on Wednesday, December 21. This transit reminds you that love and safety are what really make a home, much more so than any new furniture. Because of the pandemic and the state of the economy, 2022 was a year when many of us relocated, whether we moved somewhere less expensive, with better healthcare, or moved in with a partner or family. To be honest, there's been so much political strife affecting us that you may be unaware of such large-scale events' effect on your stress levels. You might be so busy that you have yet to have a chance to reflect on what you wish to change in your home life. And you can't make changes until you identify what you want.</p><br>
<p align = "center">Friday, December 23, brings a new moon in dedicated Capricorn. Each phase of the moon corresponds with different energy, and new moons mark new cycles. But, as with all things witchy, while lunations carry power, it's up to you to manifest the changes you wish to see in your life. But the first step is identifying what needs alterations. This night, and the entire weekend, is best spent taking it easy and checking in with yourself and your happiness levels. This astrological task is reinforced when Chiron, an astrologically significant comet known as the "wounded healer," ends its retrograde, which began in July. Chiron retrograde asked you to cut cords with people and tasks that no longer serve you so that you can make room for all the goodness the universe is bringing. And even though Mercury retrograde, the last one of 2022, begins in Capricorn on Thursday, December 29, you can relax knowing that you're very strong for making it through 2022, and the best is yet to come. </p><br>
<p align = "center">Scorpios(October 23-November 21):</p>
<img src = "scorpio.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">Back in July, a comet known as Chiron, or the "wounded healer," went retrograde. It tasked you with facing unresolved trauma, which is hard and scary, but you did it, Scorpio, even if you haven't yet celebrated your efforts. Every time you reached out to a friend, made time for meditation, or simply processed emotions, you helped yourself heal. Friday, December 23, brings a new moon in hardworking Capricorn, but this is not a night for professional tasks. Instead, the stars urge you to treat yourself with a small gift and lots of self-soothing to celebrate how much spiritual growth 2022 saw.</p><br>
<p align = "center"> beware that Mercury retrograde begins on Thursday, December 29. Try not to let this damper your spirit; you have so much to celebrate. Allow extra travel time to any parties, expect delays, and of course, the infamous sneak attack of texts from drunk exes. Continue to work on staying present while out on the town, not just while meditating at home, and you should have a fabulous entrance into the new year.</p><br>
<img src = "saggitarius.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">You're an extravagant sign, Sagittarius, and you tend to have fun during the holiday season despite the stress. You're always the life of the party and appreciate any reason to celebrate life. But, as the sign of higher learning (and no, this doesn't mean you need to be an academic, there are many ways to expand knowledge), you understand that, especially in this economy, the capitalist undertones can put a lot of pressure on folks this time of year. On Friday, December 9, Venus, the planet of love, wealth, and all things beautiful, enters grounded Capricorn and your 2nd House of Possessions. This transit does mean that you have presents on the mind, both for yourself (check out our gift guide for Sagittariuses) and your loved ones. But you don't have to break the bank to enjoy unwrapping.</p><br>
<p align = "center">On this same date, Chiron, a comet known as the "wounded healer," ends its retrograde, which started in July. Chiron is all about healing past wounds, so when it goes direct on this date, you should feel your power in full force. See, Sag? You're so busy soaking in joy even to notice that the sun left your sign and entered Capricorn on Wednesday, December 21. And yes, you can continue to act like it's your season by being the most entertaining person at any holiday party and looking hot (and making out with hotties) on New Year's Eve. Mercury retrograde starts again on Thursday, December 29, so when planning your festivities, allow extra travel time, expect a few communication mishaps, and keep your cool if you run into any exes. But overall, December just wants to bring you pleasure and joy, Sag, so soak it in. </p><br>
<p align = "center" >Capricon(December 22-January 19):</p>
<img src = "capricon.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">Welcome to 2022, Capricorn! There are many beautiful things about being a Capricorn. You're intelligent, loyal, and the hardest working sign of the zodiac. But, of course, you also have a devilish streak. The year begins in your sign, Capricorn, so kick off 2022 with all the confidence in the world. There's a new moon in your sign on Sunday, January 2. New moons mark fresh starts and are an excellent time for intention setting. After you finish celebrating the new year, use this date to write down professional goals for 2022. It's not homework; it's a list of everything that you're going to make happen this year, you ambitious sea-goat. </p><br>
<p align = "center">The first Mercury retrograde begins on Friday, January 14. While in retrograde, the communication planet enters your sign on Tuesday, January 26, before going direct on Thursday, February 3. Usually, communication flows more easily than usual when Mercury is in your sign. But, unfortunately, when it happens during a retrograde, you feel the effects more than others. Travel delays, communication mishaps, and technological slowdowns are likely to occur. You can be blunt at times, Capricorn. Waiting for a subway or getting too many texts while you're at work can really annoy you. While Mercury retrograde is in your sign, make sure always to take a deep breath before you speak or respond to texts and emails. You'll feel extra reactive during this time, and there will be more triggers to set you off. </p><br>
<p align = "center">There's a full moon in your sign on Wednesday, July 13. Full moons are times of culmination and manifestation. Think back to the intentions you set earlier this year during the Capricorn new moon. How many of your goals have you achieved? It's okay if you haven't checked everything off your list. But use this lunation as an opportunity to check in with your goals and identify where progress needs to be made. </p><br>
<p align = "center">Messenger Mercury enters your sign on Tuesday, December 6, where it will stay through the end of the year. Communication flows so much easier when Mercury is in your sign (and not retrograde!). Life becomes instantly less stressful. Also, around this time, Venus enters your sign on Friday, December 9, where it will stay through the end of the year. These two transits bring major blessings to your love life. As you may know, Capricorns have an unfair reputation for being heartless. Most often, you're just not sure how to express your emotions. So step up to the challenge. Go ahead and propose, ask your partner to move in together, or finally ask that fox on Tinder out. The planets are in your favor.</p><br>
<p align = "center">Capricorn season begins on Wednesday, December 21. Because your birthday falls during the holidays, make sure to carve out time to celebrate you, and only you! You deserve it after working so hard this year, both in business and in love. But use the new moon in your sign on Friday, December 23 to take a break from stressing about work or romantic interests. Dive into self-care, make yourself the priority, and don't feel bad for being a little bit selfish. It's Capricorn season, after all. So stay safe and see you next year!</p><br>
<p align = "center">Aquarius(January 20-February 18):</p>
<img src = "aquarius.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">Welcome to 2022, gorgeous Aquarius! Before we go further, let's point out what the infamous planet Mercury is up to. Messenger Mercury enters your sign on Sunday, January 2, before going retrograde on Friday, January 14. It briefly enters Capricorn on Tuesday, January 25, and goes direct on Thursday, February 3. Then, Mercury reenters Aquarius before finally leaving your sign for Pisces on Wednesday, March 9. So what does that all mean? Well, double-check your emails and texts during January and February. Whether Mercury is moving in and out of your sign or going retrograde, it's going to be harder to communicate effectively. You can also expect travel delays and technological mishaps. So allow for extra travel time, and as always, make sure that you're sexting the right person.</p><br>
<p align = "center">On Wednesday, January 19, your ruling planet Uranus goes direct. It's been retrograde since Thursday, August 19, 2021. While Uranus is retrograde, life can actually feel calmer. The planet spends 40 percent of the year retrograde, after all, so you can't stress too much over it. But, when Uranus is retrograde, it does ask that you stop dragging your feet. If you know in your heart that it's time to say goodbye to a toxic job or relationship, now is the time to do so. Uranus retrograde can also help us establish healthy patterns from day to day. Take a step back from stressing out about the bigger picture and set up a sustainable routine that works in enough self-care to prevent burnout. </p><br>
<p align ="center">A dark new moon falls in your sign on Tuesday, February 1. New moons are tremendous opportunities, Aquarius. They represent fresh starts and are a powerful time to set intentions. Write a list of what you want out of love and your professional life. The planets are about to fall into your favor. </p><br>
<p align = "center">Your ruling planet, eccentric Uranus, goes retrograde again on Wednesday, August 24, where it will stay through Sunday, January 22, 2023. Remember, Aquarius, you've got this. Even if you sometimes come across as cold or detached, you care deeply about the world around you.  You're not afraid to be yourself, and you always try to help your community. Specifically, you may notice how you inspire others to speak out to live authentically and fight inequality. But Uranus retrograde reminds you to take care of yourself, too. 2022 brings joy and harmony in your love life (and hopefully some money moves) so celebrate over the holidays and see you next year</p><br>
<p align = "center">Pisces(February 19-March 20):</p>
<img src = "pisces.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">Happy 2022, pretty Pisces! You only have to wait a month before the Sun enters your sign, kicking off Pisces season, on Friday, February 18. You're an emotional water sign, Pisces, but as a result, you're also the most psychic sign of the zodiac. It's hard having superpowers though, and as a result, you can get stuck in your head and let anxiety take over. Whether you take up meditation or start therapy, work on lowering those stress levels so that you can relax and enjoy your birthday</p><br>
<p align = "center">There's a new moon in your sign, Pisces, on Wednesday, March 2. Each month, a new moon brings us an opportunity to reset, especially when it falls in your sign. You're represented by the fish, and you really do thrive in water. So use this new moon to take a detoxifying hot bath with lots of fun bath bombs. If you're really feeling extra, sprinkle rose petals in your tub. </p><br>
<p align = "center">The communication planet Mercury enters your sign on Wednesday, March 9, where it will stay through Sunday, March 27. Don't take this the wrong way, Pisces, but sometimes you can fall into people-pleasing. Do you feel comfortable going to that crowded party, or are you just trying to be chill to impress a crush? When Mercury is in your sign, your task is to honestly and assertively assert yourself. </p><br>
<p align = "center">Next up, the lover planet Venus enters your sign on Tuesday, April 5, staying through Monday, May 2. At times during 2021, you felt pretty frustrated with your love life. You're charming, successful, and cute as hell, but you still felt as if you were striking out. The only thing that was missing, Pisces, was confidence. Because disciplinarian Saturn is in independent Aquarius all year, everyone's asked to find a way to stay true to themselves. While Venus is in your sign, you get that extra boost of swagger from the universe. So go ahead and tell your partner that you love them or ask that crush out. You have so much to offer.</p><br>
<p align = "center">Your ruling planet, Neptune, goes retrograde on Tuesday, June 28, before going direct on Saturday, December 3. Neptune is a psychic, dreamy, playful trickster, just like you, Pisces. When Neptune goes direct, you're tasked with identifying illusions in your life. Or, in other words, get ready to be called out. If you're dragging yourself into work every day, completely miserable, Neptune retrograde will motivate you to start looking for a new job.</p><br>
<p align = "center">Circle Saturday, September 10 in your calendar, which brings a full moon in your sign. Full moons mean manifestation, which means results, baby. It's a great day to hear back about a professional opportunity; just remember to practice self-soothing techniques to keep your emotions in check. Full moons can bring out everyone's sensitive side. You're going to have a great year, Pisces, and see you in 2023!</p><br>

    <div class="about"><h1 align = "center">DAILY HORORSCOPE</h1>
<p align = "center">Astrology is an extremely complex study, the most fundamental principle of astrology centers on the 12 familiar star signs of the zodiac. Over the centuries, each sign has developed its own associations — including myths, animals, and colors — and its own characteristics. Every sign is illuminated by its own point of view, complete with powerful strengths and exhausting weaknesses.</p><br>
<p align = "center">Aries(March 21-April 19):</p>
<img src = "aries.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">Aries loves to be number one, so it's no surprise that these audacious rams are the first sign of the zodiac. Bold and ambitious, Aries dives headfirst into even the most challenging situations (which is appropriate, since the body part associated with Aries is the head). Like their fellow fire signs, Leo and Sagittarius, Aries is a passionate, motivated, and confident leader who builds community with their cheerful disposition and relentless determination. Uncomplicated and direct in their approach, they often get frustrated by exhaustive details and unnecessary nuances.Aries is a cardinal sign that kicks off not only the spring season but also the entire zodiac wheel. In the case of Aries, however, there is no inherited wisdom: Aries leads with blind optimism, barreling through life with an electric joie de vivre that perfectly complements their distinctive impulsivity. These fire signs think after they leap, which often results in lessons learned the hard way. Aries represents the singular spirit (while Aries's opposite sign, Libra, symbolizes partnership). These rams adhere to an "every person for themselves" philosophy. While this self-determination can be inspiring, Aries needs to watch out for selfish tendencies.This sign is ruled by Mars, the dynamic red planet named after the Roman god of war. Accordingly, these courageous rams are always armed and ready for battle. Aries is known for an explosive temper, and although their outbursts don't last long, it's definitely best to avoid fiery rams until the steam has dissipated. But when these brazen rams are not flying off the handle, they're upbeat, positive, and playful creatures who enjoy living life to the fullest. You can always spot an Aries excelling on the sports field, speeding down the highway, or organizing a vibrant party game.</p><br>
<p align = "center">Taurus(April 20-May 20):</p>
<img src = "taurus.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">Taurus is an earth sign represented by the bull. Like their celestial spirit animal, Taureans enjoy relaxing in serene, bucolic environments, surrounded by soft sounds, soothing aromas, and succulent flavors. Taurus is ruled by Venus, the enchanting planet that governs love, beauty, and money. Taurus's Venusian influence make this earth sign the most sensual of the zodiac: These cosmic oxen are enchanted by any physical manifestation of comfort and luxury.It's true that in their perfect world, Taureans would spend all day bathing in a tub overflowing with essential oils. At the same time, these earth signs know the value of a dollar. Taureans aren't afraid to roll up their sleeves and work hard to earn big rewards. They're ambitious, focused, and resilient and they feel most secure when steadily putting money into a savings account.As a sign, Taurus is fixed, an astrological quality that reflects Taurus's steadfast, loyal nature. Fixed signs are excellent at maintaining systems and Taureans prioritize consistency and reliability in all areas of their lives. It must be noted, however, that Taurus does have a bit of a reputation: What a Taurus perceives as dedication is often regarded by others as stubbornness. Accordingly, these bulls may end up lingering in unhealthy situations — whether relationships, jobs, or homes — longer than necessary just to prove a point. Despite their occasional obstinance, however, Taureans are dependable partners, soothing their friends and lovers with their trustworthiness and devotion.</p><br>
<p align  ="center">Gemini(May 21-June 20):</p>
<img src = "gemini.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">Gemini season begins on May 21, a day that ushers in the heat and electricity of summer. Gemini is accordingly excellent at guiding change and transformation. These curious twins are terrific pioneers, using their energy to spearhead innovative creative projects. A fearless thinker, Gemini is always down to try something new. But after they have shared their progressive vision with the world, it's best to let these twins get back to ideating: These hyperactive air signs have short attention spans and are most satisfied when they can move fluidly from one idea to the next.Gemini is constantly juggling a variety of passions, hobbies, careers, and friend groups. They are the social butterflies of the zodiac: These quick-witted twins can talk to anyone about anything. Find them buzzing between happy hours, dinner parties, and dance floors.Both Gemini and Virgo are governed by Mercury, the messenger planet of communication. Despite sharing a planetary ruler, however, these two signs are opposite in their approaches: Gemini expresses emotions externally, whereas Virgo processes internally. Gemini is all about output, so these twins love to chat and often speak with their hands (which happens to be the body part associated with Gemini). Communication is paramount for them, and they require fluent streams of transmission.They love texting and tweeting almost as much as they love talking IRL. In fact, the act of expression is often even more important to loquacious Gemini than what is actually being said — and they must remember to be thoughtful with their words. Another incredible Gemini quality, however, is that these natural chameleons can quickly recover from even the most shameful foot-in-mouth moments. Gemini moves too fast to care about embarrassing missteps: They simply move on.</p><br>
<p align  = "center">Cancer(June 21-July 22):</p>
<img src = "cancer.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">Cancer is a cardinal water sign. Represented by the crab, this oceanic crustacean seamlessly weaves between the sea and shore, representing Cancer's ability to exist in both emotional and material realms. Cancers are highly intuitive and their psychic abilities manifest in tangible spaces: For instance, Cancers can effortlessly pick up the energies in a room. These crabs are highly sensitive to their environments, as well as extremely self-protective. Much like their celestial spirit animal, Cancers are shielded by hard, external shells. At first, these crabs may be perceived as cold or distant. With time, though, Cancers reveal their gentle nature, genuine compassion, and mystical capabilities. Just don't be surprised if it takes a while to get to know them.Cancer is ruled by the moon, the celestial body that represents comfort, self-care, and maternal energies. Accordingly, Cancers tend to be domestically oriented. They love to create cozy, safe spaces that serve as their personal sanctuaries, then spend lots of time in them. Cancers care deeply about their families and are quick to adopt caregiver roles. But these crabs must be careful: When Cancers invest in someone emotionally, they risk blurring the line between attentive nurturing and controlling behavior.Cancers attract friends and lovers through their loyalty, commitment, and emotional depth. These crustaceans make excellent hosts and enjoy entertaining with comfort food and free-flowing libations. (Cancer rules the stomach, so there's nothing these crabs love more than a home-cooked meal.) If you're not a fan of Cancer's attachment to the home, that may be a bit of a problem. Though these celestial crabs avoid direct conflict by walking at an angle, they can inflict a harsh pinch with their distinctive brand of passive-aggressiveness. It may be difficult to convince a Cancer to talk openly about what's bothering them, but if you can do it without making them feel threatened, you'll build long-lasting trust.</p><br>
<p align  = "center">Leo(July 23-August 22):</p>
<img src = "leo.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">Leo is represented by the lion, and these spirited fire signs are the kings and queens of the celestial jungle. They're delighted to embrace their royal status: Vivacious, theatrical, and passionate, Leos love to bask in the spotlight and celebrate themselves. These lions are natural leaders and they enjoy cultivating friendships and romances that are artistically and creatively inspired. Leo is ruled by the sun, the dazzling celestial body that governs life and vitality. The sun never goes retrograde, and likewise, Leos are renowned for their stability, loyalty, and consistency. They are dedicated friends and lovers who put their hearts into every relationship. (Fittingly, the Leo sign governs the heart.) Lions love to watch their mates succeed — until they feel threatened. They can become impaired by their ego, pride, and jealousy when they start to fear their star power will be eclipsed. It's important for celestial lions to remember that their light is never obscured by others, and the bright shine of others' success does nothing to their own. Ultimately, Leos' own hubris is the greatest threat to their happiness.This fixed sign is known for its ambition and determination, but above all, Leos are celebrated for their remarkable bravery. In tarot, Leo is represented by the "strength" card, which depicts the divine expression of physical, mental, and emotional fortitude. Fearless optimists who refuse to accept failure, Leos will find their deep wells of courage grow as they mature.</p><br>
<p align = "center">Virgo(August 23-September 22):</p>
<img src = "virgo.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">Virgo is an earth sign historically represented by the goddess of wheat and agriculture, an association that speaks to Virgo's deep-rooted presence in the material world. Virgos are logical, practical, and systematic in their approach to life. This earth sign is a perfectionist at heart and isn't afraid to improve skills through diligent and consistent practice. Virgo rules the digestive system, which makes these earth signs especially attuned to the ingredients that make up a whole — in food and in everything else. They're hyper-aware of every detail.Virgo is governed by Mercury, the messenger planet of communication. Though Mercury also rules Gemini, these two signs are radically different: Gemini is about output and expression, whereas Virgo is about input and processing. A Virgo deals with information like a computer, transforming even the most jumbled set of information into organized, clear concepts. Though Virgos long to be meticulous in all pursuits, they must remember that constantly chasing after the ideal can be destructive when applied to self or others. Beauty exists within our imperfections and it's important for Virgos to learn that flaws are not defects.Above all else, Virgos want to help. They are kind, gentle, and supportive friends and lovers who use their incredible intellect and resourcefulness to problem-solve. Virgo's opposite sign, Pisces, offers guidance through spirituality, but Virgos want to assist on a practical level. These earth signs are always striving to provide workable solutions and improve broken systems. Methodical, committed, and hardworking, they make excellent teachers, healers, editors, and musicians.</p><br>
<p align = "center">Libra(September 23-October 22):</p>
<img src = "libra.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">Libra is an air sign represented by the scales (interestingly, the only inanimate object of the zodiac), an association that reflects Libra's fixation on balance and harmony. Libra is obsessed with symmetry and strives to create equilibrium in all areas of life. These air signs are the aesthetes of the zodiac: Ruled by Venus, the planet that governs love, beauty, and money, Libras adore high art, intellectualism, and connoisseurship. Suave Libras need to surround themselves with stunning objects and create environments that reflect their exquisite tastes. Accordingly, these air signs make excellent designers, decorators, art critics, and stylists.While Libra's opposite sign, Aries, represents "me," Libra symbolizes "we." Relationships are paramount for Libras, who find balance in companionship.Libras, when they are regularly coupled, must be careful about seeking attention outside the agreed-upon boundaries of their relationship. Since they try to keep everyone happy and engaged, they may find themselves tempted to push the limits of their agreements with their partners. People-pleasing Libras must remember that the happiness of their loved ones and the health of their relationships is more important than maintaining the attention of distant admirers.Libra is a cardinal sign, which means Libras are accordingly great at launching new initiatives. However, because Libras consider multiple perspectives in all pursuits, these air signs struggle with indecision. Instead of constantly seeking outside perspectives, Libras would do well to develop (and trust) their own intuition. Their characteristic ambivalence aside, Libras can navigate virtually any social situation, effortlessly resolving conflicts by simply turning on the charm.</p><br>
<p align = "center">Scorpios(October 23-November 21):</p>
<img src = "scorpio.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">Scorpio is one of the most misunderstood signs of the zodiac. Because of its incredible passion and power, Scorpio is often mistaken for a fire sign. In fact, Scorpio is a water sign that derives its strength from the psychic, emotional realm. Like fellow water signs, Cancer and Pisces, Scorpio is extremely clairvoyant and intuitive.Scorpios lie in wait and strike when least expected. Life is a game of chess for these calculating water signs, who are constantly plotting several steps ahead in order to orchestrate an eventual checkmate. This doesn't mean their intentions are necessarily nefarious. Scorpios simply know what they want and aren't afraid to work hard and play the long game to get itScorpio is ruled by Pluto, the planet that governs both destruction and transformation. On a good day, Scorpion energy is ambitious and enticing. On a bad day, however, the shadowy side of Scorpio is fueled by a relentless desire for control. Power-hungry Scorpios must remember that if controlled by their egos, they are at risk of poisoning themselves. This sign is at its best when that intrinsic intensity is applied to deep, soulful connections with friends and lovers. When they build trust with others, Scorpios demonstrate unparalleled empathy, depth, and commitment that brighten even the darkest parts of Scorpio's magical psyche.</p><br>
<p align = "center">Sagittarius(November 22-December 21):</p>
<img src = "saggitarius.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">The final fire sign of the zodiac, Sagittarius traits are unlike any other sign of the zodiac; they're totally unique to this brazen spirit. As a professional astrologer with almost 10 years of experience, I can honestly say that there is no zodiac sign like Sagittarius. What makes Sagittarius so unique is its dynamic blend of passion, curiosity, intensity, and adaptability. Represented by the archer (a half-man, half-horse centaur), Sagittarius isn't afraid to use its bow and arrow to explore expansive terrain, seeking answers in places and spaces others wouldn't dare venture. Whether they're white water rafting down a river in some undisclosed location or taking a pilgrimage to a sacred site to uncover secrets about an ancient civilization, Sagittarius's quest for knowledge knows no bounds.Sagittarius is a mutable sign, meaning it is associated with adaptability and flexibility. This perfectly reflects the archers' deep-rooted desire for change. Sagittarians are born to explore and it is critical that these archers have the freedom to roam. (Sagittarius rules the thighs, so these archers are always on the move.) Fueled by wanderlust, these archers can be found traversing all corners of the world on thrill-seeking expeditions, chasing after geographical, intellectual, and spiritual adventures. Sagittarians are on a perpetual quest for knowledge, which makes them incredible storytellers, entertainers, and creatives. It's not all fun and games, however: Sagittarius is notorious for its signature bluntness, and their "brutal honesty" can often lead to misunderstandings, communication breakdowns, and lots of hurt feelings.Sagittarius doesn't take anything too seriously, so it's hard to stay mad at these wild optimists.When Sagittarius is intrigued by something — whether it's a Wikipedia blackhole or a newfound internet crush — they go all in. That is, until something else catches their eye. As a mutable sign, Sagittarius don't stay on any single fascination for too long; these archers have so many passions and interests, they're constantly bouncing from one idea to the next!</p><br>
<p align = "center" >Capricon(December 22-January 19):</p>
<img src = "capricon.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">Capricorn is symbolized by the sea goat, a mythological creature with the body of a goat and tail of a fish. This imagery speaks to Capricorn's bifurcated abilities: Capricorns are skilled at navigating both the material and emotional realms. They scale the steepest mountains — Capricorn rules the knees, making it easier for this sign to climb — while simultaneously building up their psychic fortitude. Capricorns are relentless: They are determined to overcome whatever stands in their way. They have big picture, long-term goals and they absolutely don't want to be bogged-down by annoying details or superfluous information. However, because of their unwavering focus, Capricorns can sometimes be perceived as cold, unemotional, or even cutthroat — but that's only because Capricorn has perspective. If it won't matter in five years, Capricorn simply cannot be bothered with it today.Capricorn recognizes that life is short and, likewise, they're always racing against the clock. There are so many things Capricorn wants to accomplish and achieve in this lifetime; slowing down is simply not an option. As a cardinal sign, Capricorn is really motivated to start new projects — this sign is constantly coming up with new ideas!The last earth sign of the zodiac, Capricorns and their unique spirits are powerful, to say the least. Not everyone gets to see Capricorn ordering rounds of tequila, dancing on the table, and staying out until the crack of dawn — but that rebellious, untamed spirit is a Capricorn assetIndeed, inside every earnest Capricorn is a mischievous troublemaker (in tarot, Capricorn is symbolized by the "devil" card). Though this earth sign may seem a bit conservative and restrained at first, Capricorn's closest friends and lovers know that these sea goats love to party.</p><br>
<p align = "center">Aquarius(January 20-February 18):</p>
<img src = "aquarius.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">Aquarius is an air sign. As the eleventh and penultimate sign of the zodiac, Aquarius is actually the final air sign, which means it deals with air-related concepts (we'll get more into that momentarily) from a macro-perspective. Of all the zodiac signs, Aquarius is undoubtedly the most innovative, progressive, rebellious, and humanitarian. And while Aquarius can often be found planning a revolution or proudly flaunting their funky fashion sensibility, they also have an often overlooked sensitive side that requires appreciation, support, and love.Air energy is all about the mind. Intellectual, curious, and deeply social, the air signs (Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius) are passionate about interpersonal dynamics. As the last air sign in the zodiac, however, Aquarius takes these concepts to a whole other level. Aquarius is represented by the water bearer (hence the "aqua"), the mystical healer who bestows water, or life, upon the land. Represented by the Star card in tarot, Aquarius can be visualized as a larger-than-life, mythical being with one foot firmly planted on the soil (representing a sense of being grounded) and one positioned in the water. Aquarius is holding a vase, which pours new streams of inspiration to cultivate longevity, healing, and hope. Here, it's important to remember that Aquarius is removed from this process — from this vantage, we can see that Aquarius is positioned as an independent entity separate from the life-giving hydration it offers the cracked soil. In this respect, Aquarius exposes its deep connection to community: Rooted in teamwork, collaboration, and the concept of the "greater good," Aquarius is determined to make a powerful difference in the world. Aquarius is ruled by Uranus, the planet that governs innovation, technology, and surprising events. Uranus perfectly mirrors Aquarius' distinctive attitude, complementing the nontraditional nature of these visionary air signs. Aquarians are big thinkers, but mustn't forget their immediate surroundings. These water bearers can become so focused on implementing widespread reform that they neglect their family and friends, gaining a reputation for being distant in relationships. Aquarians should remember that progress always starts on a micro level and advocate empathy and compassion wherever possible.</p><br>
<p align = "center">Pisces(February 19-March 20):</p>
<img src = "pisces.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" class = "center"> <br>
<p align = "center">Pisces, a water sign, is the last constellation of the zodiac. It's symbolized by two fish swimming in opposite directions, representing the constant division of Pisces's attention between fantasy and reality. As the final sign, Pisces has absorbed every lesson — the joys and the pains, the hopes and the fears — learned by all of the other signs. This makes these fish the most psychic, empathetic, and compassionate creatures of the astrological wheel. With such immense sensitivity, Pisces can easily become swallowed by emotions and must remember to stay grounded in the material realm (appropriately, Pisces rules the feet).Pisces is ruled by Neptune, the celestial body that governs creativity and dreams, and these ethereal fish adore exploring their boundless imaginations. In its more nefarious form, however, Neptune also oversees illusion and escapism. Neptunian energy is like the energy of the ocean: magical, mysterious, and often scary. When the fog is thick on the water, the horizon is obstructed and there is no differentiation between the sea and the sky.These impressionable fish prefer wearing rose-colored glasses to addressing problems, which can earn Pisces a reputation for being flaky or delusional. This water sign should remember that problems can't be solved by swimming away. Willful ignorance never makes conflict disappear: It only gives it the chance to grow.A mutable sign, Pisces effortlessly adapts to their surroundings. These visionary fish have unparalleled access to the collective unconscious through their clairvoyance and make incredible artists and creatives. Kind and gentle, they're invigorated by shared experiences of music and romance. Any relationship with mystical Pisces is guaranteed to involve deep spiritual exploration.</p><br>
